description: Progettazione con divisione tra Front end e Back end netta
---

I need to build a web application with the following requirements:
Core Functionality:
[Describe the main purpose and key features of your application]
User Requirements:
[Describe who will use the application and what they need to accomplish]
Technical Constraints:
[Mention any specific technologies, frameworks, or limitations]
Implementation Approach:
Please break down the development into Backend and Frontend tasks:

Backend tasks (B1, B2, B3...): Database schema, API endpoints, authentication, business logic, data validation, etc.
Frontend tasks (F1, F2, F3...): UI components, user interactions, form handling, state management, API integration, etc.

For each task, please provide:

A clear description of what needs to be built
Dependencies (which tasks must be completed first)
Estimated complexity (simple/medium/complex)
Key technical considerations

Priority: I'd like to implement the backend tasks first, then move to frontend development.
Please create a structured development plan with sequenced tasks.**
